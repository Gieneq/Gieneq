# 👋 Hi

I'm a software engineer transitioning from embedded systems into backend and systems development — with a growing focus on **Rust**.

My background in low-level programming gives me a solid foundation in performance, memory, and hardware-aware development, and I'm now building out my skills in modern backend tooling, async systems, and Rust-based APIs.

## 🛠️ Current Focus

- Rust for backend (async APIs, CLI tools, web servers)
- Systems programming patterns & architecture
- PostgreSQL, Actix-web, Axum
- Docker, CI/CD, and clean deployment workflows
