# üëã Hi, I'm Piotr!

I'm a systems engineer with an embedded background ‚Äî now focused on **Rust backend, tooling, and systems development**.

To me, systems engineering means owning the full path: From hardware and firmware, through protocols and tooling, to services and user interfaces.  I've designed drivers, built cloud-connected firmware, created CLI and web tools, and automated real-world processes.

I began exploring Rust in 2023, and **since late 2024**, I‚Äôve been coding in it 4‚Äì10 hours daily ‚Äî both professionally and in personal projects. I‚Äôm now shifting fully into **Rust-focused roles** ‚Äî backend services, infrastructure, or developer tooling ‚Äî where I can apply the same precision and full-stack thinking embedded demanded, but in modern, scalable systems.

## ü¶Ä Why Rust?

- I love **type safety and reliability**
- I thrive in **low-level, performance-aware environments**
- I write **tested, maintainable code** with both unit and integration tests
- I enjoy building **tools and services that actually solve problems**
- And I‚Äôve built **real systems** already ‚Äî not tutorials

## ü¶Ä Rust Projects

Since 2023, I‚Äôve been learning and building with Rust ‚Äî both out of curiosity and to stay sharp while working in a company environment.

Starting in late 2024, I dedicated 4‚Äì10 hours daily to Rust development, creating production-grade tools for internal use and personal projects across backend, CLI, gamedev, and embedded domains.

My focus is on writing high-quality, maintainable code ‚Äî backed by unit and integration tests ‚Äî to automate processes, improve reliability, and reduce uncertainty.
