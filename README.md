# üëã Hi, I'm Piotr!

I'm an engineer with a deep background in embedded RTOS systems, now fully driving into the world of Rust. Currently focusing on Rust ‚Äî backend, tooling, and systems programming.

## ü¶Ä Rust Projects

Since 2023, I‚Äôve been learning and building with Rust ‚Äî both out of curiosity and to stay sharp while working in a company environment.

Starting in late 2024, I dedicated 4‚Äì10 hours daily to Rust development, creating production-grade tools for internal use and personal projects across backend, CLI, gamedev, and embedded domains.

My focus is on writing high-quality, maintainable code ‚Äî backed by unit and integration tests ‚Äî to automate processes, improve reliability, and reduce uncertainty.
